# KNOWN BUGS #

*Need to make sure Google Callback in Oauth is registered*

Upon sign-in, the bulk of the app is not inside a protected route
Current sign-in functionality is essentially a pop up window

Current features do not have CRUD operations

Itineraries
- when you click 'Add Trip' it goes inside the /itineraries protected route and shows a 401 as a result

Events
- Cannot pick days on the calendar

Budget
- Add transaction button causes page refresh
